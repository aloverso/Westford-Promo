 * Expo runs 2PM - 4PM
 * 1:30 PM - Cafeteria closes, interns arrive and begin setup

Setup
-----
Need to consider where food will be in relation to the projects. We could have
it by the entrance, the idea being that people enter, get an intern expo
brochure, then get ice cream and proceed into the expo and enjoy ice cream
while listening to our presentations. Experience from the intern meet and greet
during intern orientation has illustrated that this is a fairly effective
method for getting people interested, and most tended to stick around to talk
to us for a while.

Power strips will be necessary. The cafeteria has power outlets located in
groups of four along the five columns that divide the windows along the
outer edge of the cafeteria. Power outlets are only available on that
side of the room -- the side closer to the kitchen has no power outlets.

The long tables in the cafeteria may be suitable for presentations.
However, we'll have to move the tables around -- this may be part of our setup
work. Along the windows are the round high tables, which either need to be
moved out of the way or otherwise put to use for presentations.

Monitor setup requires first getting the monitors from the lab -- Greg will
probably be responsible/leader on this effort. We'll also need several people
to accompany him to/from the lab to bring over monitors. In the cafeteria,
we'll need to set up power strips for laptops/monitors and get everybody set up
with a monitor, or as best we can if we have less supply than we have people.

Monitor/Machine setup for remote intern -- need to procure extra machine, which
involves a service desk request, or otherwise finding a means of supplying
extra machines -- perhaps bring in personal laptops.

There are two projectors in the cafeteria, one located at either end of the
cafeteria. We'll need to set up the group slideshow to auto-play on these,
which means we'll also need a laptop to run the slideshow on.

Running the Expo
----------------
The expectation for layout at the event will be self-organization. This isn't
expected to be an issue as our intern group is small.

We'll need a way to distribute at-event promotional materials such as brochures
to attendees. We can either have someone stand at the door handing them out or
just place them in a pile and assume people will take them as they enter.

Each person will be standing in front of their laptop/monitor with their
presentation ready. As attendees come and go, interns will present their
slideshows, answers questions about their projects, etc.

Teardown
--------
 * Restore tables
 * Return monitors
